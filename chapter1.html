			</ul></b></p>
			<p>    The earliest known tool of computation was the abacus, and it was invented in Babylon c. 2400 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. The abacus although it was generally used for mathematical addition, it can be considered the start of computation. The Chinese built on the abacus and called it a “Suanpan”, which allowed for more complex addition and multiplication. <br></p>
			<p>    In 1110 BC, the south-pointing chariot was invented in China. It was the first known geared mechanism to use a differential gear, this was infact later used in the first analog computers. The south-pointing chariot was two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the south, no matter how the chariot turned, almost like an upside-down compass.<br><p/>
			<p>    In 300 BC Indian mathematician and scholar Pingala first described the binary number system which is now used in the design of essentially all modern computing equipment. He also made use of a binary code similar to create an early version of the Morse code.<br><p/>
			<p>    Chinese inventor Liang Lingzan built the world's first fully mechanical clock in 724 AC. Until this point water clocks, although extremely accurate, had been used for centuries. This was an important technological leap forward the earliest true computers, used technology based on that of clocks.<br><p/>
			<p>    850 AC - Arab mathematician, Al-Kindi, was a pioneer of cryptography. He gave the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis. This was used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown. The cryptographic key was especially an algorition to decipher a specific piece data that has been encrypted.<br><p/>
			<p>    During 1492 Leonardo da Vinci produced drawings of a device consisting of interlocking cog wheels which can be seen as a plan for mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction. A working model inspired by this plan was built in 1968 but it it is still not clear whether da Vinci really had a calculator in mind.<br><p/>
			<p>    French polymath Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator, called machine arithmetique, Pascal's calculator and eventually Pascaline, after its public introduction in 1645 started the development of mechanical calculators first in Europe and then in the rest of the world. It was the first machine to have a controlled carry mechanism, that was durable to be moved around while in use, and not break or fail to give the correct output.<br><p/>
			<p>    From 1930 - 1950, computing technology advancements grew rapidly, particularly because of military funding in both World Wars. <br><p/>
			<p>    The differential analyser is a mechanical analogue computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, using wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. It was one of the first advanced computing devices to be used operationally. However it was absolutely huge ie it would fill a very large room, and it also cost $25,000 to make, which for its functionality was a ridiculous amount of money.<br><p/>
			<p>    The Z1 was a mechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse from 1935 to 1936 and built by him from 1936 to 1938. The Z1 was the first freely programmable computer in the world which used Boolean logic (true or false basically) and binary floating point numbers (kind of like powers in maths) , however it was unreliable in operation. It was a binary electrically driven mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from punched celluloid film ie a piece of card with holes in it which corresponded to the input.<br><p/>
			<p>    An audio oscillator is an instrument that generates one pure tone / frequency at a time. Through the years, HP oscillators were used to design, produce and maintain telephones,  stereos, radios and some other audio equipment. The Model 200A began as the project of Bill Hewlett's master's qualification at Stanford University. Bill had the idea of using a light bulb in a Wein bridge oscillator circuit to solve the problem of how to regulate the output of the circuit without causing distortion to the frequency. Other oscillators that were available at that time were very costly, unstable and sounded bad. By the use of the light bulb, Bill was able to simplify the circuit and improve the oscillator's performance and even reduce the price.<br><p/>
			<p>    The 1940 the first CNC or "computer numerical controlled" were created as machines that acted as a very sophisticated metalworking tool that could create complicated parts required by modern technology. The demand for such machine was very high with the advances in computers at the time, CNCs can be found performing work as, milling machines, laser / abrasive jet cutters and other industrial tools.<br><p/>
			<p>    One of the most famous examples was the of computing in the War was Colossus, which was the name given to a series of computers designed by the british codebreakers in 1943-1945, to aid in the deciphering of the Lorenz cipher. Colossus was designed specifically by Thomas Flowers to solve a problem posed by Max Newman, a mathematician, at the Cypher School at Bletchley park. Another contributor was Alan Turing, who used his probability in the cryptanalysis to aid in its design. Interestingly Turning is often known for designing Colossus, to break the German enigma,but this was actually named Bombe, and to two machines are often mixed up. Bombe was actually created before the Colossus. Ten colossi were used by the end of the war, and they collectively gave the Allies huge amounts of military intelligence by intercepting radio transmissions between the German forces, most importantly the army command to the armies scattered throughout Europe. The colosi cost $750,000 to make and weigh more than a car, just shows how much computers have advanced in the modern age.<br><p/>
			<p>    Similar to the colosi, Bombe was an electromagnetic decryption device to help break the German enigma, the US also made copies of Bombe was the Allies were able to gain intelligence by sharing deciphered messages between each other. The bombe was designed to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks. Many people consider the fact the Allies were able to gain this intelligence was the reason the Allies had the ability to win the war.<br><p/>
			<p>    The Enigma was the encryption device the Germans used, and the reason the Bombe was created in the first place. Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War 1. Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s for business and other private affairs, but were later used by the military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany. Although the Enigma was cracked by three Polish cryptanalysts, Jerzy Rozycki, Marian Rejewski  and Henryk Zygalski, they used theoretical maths to solve it. As the encryption technology in the Enigma advanced this method was no longer a viable solution, and people could not try all combinations quick, therefore they had to look at computers to do it for them.<br><br><p/>
			<p>    Now that computing has been around for quite a while, generations have been thought up to simplify the transition of how it started to present day. There are five generations in the world of computing. <br><p/>
			<p>    The first being Vacuum Tubes from 1940 - 1956. In the first computers vacuum tubes were used for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often huge, taking up entire rooms. They were very expensive to operate and and also used a massive amount of electricity, this mean the first computers generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions. First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, to perform the operations inputted by the users, and they could only solve one problem at a time, and it could take days or weeks to set-up a new problem. Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and output was printed out, as digit screens did not work how they do nowadays.<br><p/>
			<p>    Next came the use of Transistors from 1956 - 1963 Transistors were invented in 1947, however were not implemented into computers until the late 1950s. Transistors were far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient and more reliable than the first-generation before it because the heat output was less, so there were less errors for that reason. Unfortunately there was no improvement of the input and output methods of transistor computers, ie they still relied on punch cards for input, and printouts for outputs. Second-generation computers moved from binary machine language to assembly, languages, which allowed programmers to create instructions in words. High-level programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as earlier versions of FORTRAN and COBOL. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory, allowing for better productivity. This was a result of the discarding of the magnetic drum, and the use of magnetic core technology.  Interestingly this generation was initially developed for the atomic industry, to control the production of energy from radioactive substances.<br><p/>
			<p>    The third generation was from 1964-1971 and was focused on the Integrated Circuit. Transistors were shrunk and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which massively increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Additionally the third generation ought with it new ways to input and output data. Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with the computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with the computer using an operating system. The use of an operation system allow the user to run multiple different applications at the same time. This was also the time that computers became accessible to a the average consumer because they were smaller and cheaper than before and also a lot easier to use due to the new interfaces.<br><p/>
			<p>    Then came the microprocessor, which was the next generation of computer from 1971 - the present day. The microprocessor allow for thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, this chip located all the components of the computer from the central processing unit (CPU) and memory to input/output controls all on a single chip ! In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced their Macintosh system. This is considered to be the start of the modern age of computing as normal people could not only afford, but use a computer to better their lives, by completing tasks faster / more efficiently. Microprocessors also allow for applications of computing outside the use of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors for example, dishwashers, microwaves and other household appliances at the time. This generation also brought with it new input devices such as a mouse and other handheld input devices, additionally GUIs for applications on computers because common, once again making computers more user friendly.<br>As these small computers became more and more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the Internet.<br><p/>
			<p>    The final generation that also continues to the present is Artificial Intelligence. Computing devices, based on artificial intelligence, are currently still in development, though there are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. The use of parallel processing (the use of more than one CPU to execute a program) and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence more and more advanced. Quantum computation (uses aspects of quantum physics to execute tasks much faster) and molecular and nanotechnology (trying to make computer chips smaller and produce less heat so they can run faster) will change the world of computers in future. Overall the current goal of the goal of fifth generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization. One of the most recent uses of Artificial Intelligence is at Sheffield University that have created swarm robot that can learn things by simply watching things happen, even without being told what to look for, according to researchers. <br><p/>

			<h3><br>How Computers Help Us Think</h3>
			<p>The 4 main constructs of Computational Thinking are: <b>Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition and Algorithms:<br><br>
			Decompostion - </b>breaking down any problem into a lot more managable chunks to solve.<br>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li><u>Advantages</u>
					<ul>
						<li>It means that you're not overwhelmed by the amount of work it seems is require, if you do it piece by piece.</li> 
						<li>Means you do exactly what is required, as decomposition requires some planning, which will make the end result more accurate to the target, compared to going with the flow.</li>
					</ul>		
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><u>Disadvantages</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Solving a problem in chunks may cause you to drift away from the overall goal, and therefore the chunks do not fit together at the end quite the way they should.</li>
						<li>Decomposition assumes that the whole solution to the problem is known in advance. And often this a problem is given to, design and work out the solution.</li>
					</ul>		
				</li>
			</ul>
			Object Oriented Programming is another way of breaking down problems and even the functionality at the same time. An object / class often contains lots of data. These objects are isolated from each other, which avoids interference problems, and it also gives the opportunity to reuse the same object data in the future for other problems.<br>
			<hr id="divider1" class="divider">
			
			<b>Pattern Recognition - </b>looking for similarities among different problems and solving them in similar ways to before.<br>
			<hr id="divider1" class="divider">
			<b>Algorithms - </b>a step by step solution to a problem, or the rules in which to follow to solve the problem.<br>
			<hr id="divider1" class="divider">
			<b>Recursion - </b>is where something is defined in times of itself. A good example is using a function name within the same functions definition, to restart the function, this can cause infinite loops within the function.<br>
			An example of this is the GNU operating system. GNU is a recursive acronym is an acronym that refers to itself. This is applicable as GNU stands for <b>G</b>NU's <b>N</b>ot <b>U</b>nix. <br>
			<hr id="divider1" class="divider">
			<b>To the right is my answer to the question:</b><br>
			A library accepts new members and stores data about them.  It issues them with a card.  It also updates membership details when necessary.  When the member leaves, the record for that member is deleted.<br><br>
			Express this system as a data flow diagram:
