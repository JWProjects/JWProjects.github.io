		  	<h1> Chapter 2: Elements of Computational Thinking <br></h1>
			<p><br>
			<b>Thinking Abstractly - </b>Abstraction is the process of filtering out ignoring the characteristics of patterns that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is also the filtering out of specific details. From this we create a representation (idea) of what we are trying to solve.<br>Abstraction allows us to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve it. The process instructs us to remove all specific detail, and any patterns that will not help us solve our problem. This helps us form our idea of the problem. This idea is known as a model. If we do not abstract we may end up with the wrong solution to the problem we are trying to solve.<br><br>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li><u>When baking a cake, there are some general characteristics between cakes. For example:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>a cake needs ingredients</li> 
						<li>each ingredient needs a specified quantity</li>
						<li>a cake needs timings</li>
					</ul>		
				</li>
			</ul>
			When abstracting, we remove specific details and keep the general relevant patterns. General patterns Specific details. We need to know that a cake has ingredients. We don't need to know what those ingredients are. We need to know that each ingredient has a specified quantity. We do not need to know what that quantity is. We need to know that each cake needs a specified time to bake.<br><br>
			<b>Thinking Ahead - </b>First was whether I needed to get up for the school bus, as sometimes I can come in later if I have no lessons.<br>While planning when to come into school, I identified which resources I would need for the lessons I had today. Both of these were the night before.<br>When waking up I decided what I was going to eat for breakfast after showering.<br>After catching the bus I predicted the time it would get to school, and whether I would go to the common room, or go straight to my form room.<br>As I was going to leave school earlier than 3pm I needed to get a public bus so I had to plan which busses and at what time I would catch them to get home. I planned it so I left school slightly earlier, so when changing busses in Halifax I had time to get some food because I was hungry.<br><br>
			<b>Thinking Procedurally - </b>When designing any application for a computer system that is to be split among a team of people, as the completed aspects of the application must work together. Order of execution needs to be taken into account as it may may be that you need data to be processed by one module before another can use it. Particularly as it can be unpredictable as to how each part will will work when used with the rest of the chunks.<br><br>
			<b>Thinking Logically - </b>In any program there are going to be decisions, so as to branch the code off. Decisions are based on Boolean expressions. In a flowchart a diamond shape is used for decision, as you can have an input coming in one corner, and the yes or no coming out the others.<br>In a flowchart a diamond shape is used for decision, as you can have an input coming in one corner, and the yes or no coming out the others.<br>In a programming language a decision is made by an IF statement, this can extend to an ELSE if for the opposite side o f the decision, and ELSEIF can be used if there are more than two possible outcomes to the decision.<br><br>
			<b>Thinking Concurrently - </b>Concurrent means acting / happening at the same time, this relates to computers nowadays as they can process multiple tasks at the same time, due to multi core CPU technology. <br><br>
			<b>Backtracking - </b>is an algorithmic approach to a problem where partial solutions to a large problem are built up as a pathway to follow. Backtracking is retracing steps to get to a place in the past to remember something. I frequently backtrack to remember where an item I have lost, might be.<br><br>
			<b>Data Mining - </b>is using pre-existing data from databases, to create new information on the topic you require. In business it could be used to identify the the percentage of men and women buying men and women's deodorant. If say the women buy more you might want to raise the price to squeeze out more profit and in the men, have a sale to get more men using the product.<br><br>
			<b>Performance Monitoring - </b>Performance monitoring is used to monitor specific areas in a computer system. For example CPU clock speed, heat output, load etc. This is very important as it can provide solutions as to why the computer keeps encountering errors, ie could be overheating. It is useful to identify if all parts of a computer are connected and functioning as they should, as sometimes a computer may not be assembled correctly, resulting in say a fan not working, or some of the RAM not being recognised. <br>Performance could be used in the real world for network speeds in a film company, that requires their video files to be transferred to editors at reliable speeds, as a failure to do this would affect the workflow of the whole company.<br><br>
			<b>Pipelining - </b>is a term used for when lots of instructions are being executed, and the output of one process will become the input for the next process. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel therefore some amount of buffer storage (appropriate temporary storage capacity) is often inserted between processes.<br><br>
			<b>Visualisation - </b>the Strava Heat Mapping, is used to help members identify the best routes for running / cycling. They show this visually on a normal map of the roads. The most popular routes used by other Strava members are coloured in, and the more the route is used the darker it gets or it will change colour altogether. Therefore it is easier for members to find the most popular routers, by looking which has the most popularity. <br><br>
